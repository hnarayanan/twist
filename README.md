# twist: Automated algorithms for finite strain elasticity

## Introduction

Nonlinear elasticity theory plays a fundamental role in modelling the
mechanical response of many polymeric and biological materials. Such
materials are capable of undergoing finite deformation, and their
material response is often characterised by complex, nonlinear
constitutive relationships. Because of these difficulties, predicting
the response of such materials to arbitrary loads requires numerical
computation (usually based on the finite element method).

The steps involved in the construction of the required finite element
algorithms are classical and straightforward in principle, but their
application to non-trivial material models are typically tedious and
error-prone. `twist` is a Python package that hopes to elegantly solve
this problem.
