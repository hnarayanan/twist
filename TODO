** Figure out why the Gent-Thomas material model does not converge
** Figure out how to specify material models in terms of principal stretches.
*** This might require UFL hacking to handle trigonometric functions (and derivatives) of functions.
** Figure out how to specify material models in terms of modified strains
*** This requires specification of higher order tensors and their products (contraction, for instance)
** Show how to set Dirichlet boundary conditions for some (not all) of the displacement components
